# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

Before you start, read the **README.md** file for info on the project and how to set it up.

## Best Practices

Before you post any issue or pull request, search [the issues][issues] and [the pull requests][pulls] to see if it has already been addressed. 

[issues]: https://github.com/toolkito/laravel-social-auto-posting/issues
[pulls]: https://github.com/toolkito/laravel-social-auto-posting/pulls

Here are some best practices that will help us accept/address pull requests and issues:

* Outline one, **and only one**, specific problem/feature that you are trying to address.
* Write a **good title** that summarizes the specific problem.
* Introduce the problem before you write any code.

## Pull Requests

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/laravel-social-auto-posting.git

Make your changes and push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/toolkito/laravel-social-auto-posting/compare

At this point you're waiting on us. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
